Short term:

(1.1) Refactor MiniCheckers/src/gui/ to follow MVC. Corrently BoardFrame.java is responsible for View and Controller functions.
(1.2) Change board representation. Currently it uses Position with fields `Long positionID`, `byte[][] board` and some other fields. Would be nice to turn into byte[] boardWithMetadata` containing metadata (board dimensions, ply count) and tokkens. `Long positionID` is rarely needed and can be calculated on the fly. 
(1.3) Standartize methods in Utils. Legal moves/jumps are computed using several deprecated methods.
(1.4) Add save/load game feature. `List<Long> positionIDSequence` should be sufficient at first.
(1.5) Add unit tests.

Long term:
(2.1) Add support for larger boards. Single `Long positionID` is insufficient for 10x10 board for example.
(2.2) Add JPA. In memory Map works for 6x6 board, but is insufficient for larger boards. 
(2.3) Add messaging for pvp games.
